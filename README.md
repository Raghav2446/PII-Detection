# 🔒 PII Guardian — Indian PII Detection & Redaction Tool

PII Guardian is a privacy-first Python tool that detects, classifies, and redacts **Indian PII (Personally Identifiable Information)** from text, PDFs, and images. It combines multiple AI-powered techniques — including [Microsoft Presidio](https://github.com/microsoft/presidio), spaCy, custom regex rules, and OCR (with Hindi script support) — to scan data and mask sensitive content effectively.

> ⚡ Designed for Indian formats like Aadhaar, PAN, mobile numbers, emails, names, and more.  
> 🖥️ Comes with a full **Streamlit-based UI** for easy interaction.  
> 📄 Works on plain text, scanned documents (PDFs), and images using OCR.  
> 🔐 Supports smart redaction, severity scoring (Critical / Medium / Low), and customizable masking.

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ **Multi-source support**: Detect PII in text files, PDFs, and images (JPEG, PNG).
- 🌐 **Streamlit Web UI**: Intuitive interface to upload and process documents without CLI.
- 🔍 **High accuracy detection**: Uses spaCy NER, Microsoft Presidio, regex, and OCR in layers.
- 🇮🇳 **Indian PII focus**: Aadhaar, PAN, Voter ID, Indian phone numbers, emails, names, and addresses.
- 🧠 **Multi-language OCR**: Hindi and English document support via Tesseract.
- 🎯 **Risk classification**: Tags detected PII as Critical / Medium / Low.
- 🛡️ **Smart masking & redaction**: Mask sensitive parts only, retain context.
- 🧱 Modular architecture: Easily extend with custom PII recognizers or new formats.
